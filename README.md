This repo contains my solutions for the programming assignments of the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) 'Functional Programming Principles in Scala' by EPFL and Coursera. 

May it serve as a source of help/inspiration for people who are taking the course and want to compare their own solution with an alternative one. 

However, under no circumstances should you copy or submit any of the solutions provided here. This would not only be a violation of the _Coursera Honor Code_ but it would also keep you from learning anything on your own.
